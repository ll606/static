		<p>
			I participated in the competition of Classifying Tabular Playground Series held on the Kaggle. I used pandas and numpy to do feature engineering, including using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler within the scikit-learn module, for the data I downloaded from the platform. Then I decided to use K nearest Neighbours algorism to process the data and use method of grid search to find out the best hyper parameters. Finally, my model reached the accuracy rate of 98.267% and I won the 79th place.

		</p>
		<p>
			Key skills: <b>Statistics Skill, Establishing Statistical Model, Testing Statistical Model, IT skill – Machine Learning </b></p>
		<p>
			I used <b>Python</b>, a popular programming language, <b>to establish a statistical model</b> to predict what companies would bankrupt in 2020 based on their data in 2019. The model has a high level of performance, whose specificity rates are higher than 99% and whose sensitivity rates are higher than 90%. Also, through <b>Chi-Squared tests</b> and two proportion Z tests, this model shows that it has a much higher level of performance than the traditional quick ratio in the respect of bankruptcy prediction.

			I analysed the business strategies and financial performance of a delivery company based in Hongkong. For its business strategies, I analysed it through political, economic, social-cultural and technological factors (PEST) and the model of strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) so that I took into account both the external environment and its past performance trends. For its financial performance, I found out the reasons behind the changes in its expenses and revenues.
